# <span style="color: #20B2AA;">Task Manager</span>

This is the backedn web api for the Task Manager/list project (Front end can be found [here](https://github.com/MikeJones999/TaskListSpaUI))

once pulled down go into the main directory (tasklist-ui)

open terminal/command line -> npm install, -> npm run dev

Should run on port http://localhost:5173 - the Api should be running on https://localhost:7082


Once the backed has been started - the system has a user already setup to demo and play with, or you can register a new user to try from scratch. 

The details for the test user are hard coded into the login page and will be visible when you navigate there
